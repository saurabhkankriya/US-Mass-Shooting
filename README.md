## US MASS SHOOTINGS (1966-2017) ##

The [US Mass Shootings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years) contains an overview of shooting incidents that have occurred in the United States of America. 
It contains 320 rows of data from last 50 years i.e. from 1966 to 2017. The dataset provides a summary of the shooting incident and 
the number of total victims (injured + killed). Apart from this, the data contains geographical location and information about 
the shooter's gender, race and mental health issues. 


## Motivation ##

I see this dataset from Kaggle as a means of practically getting started with **R** and gaining hands on experience in **Data Analysis**. 
I wanted to perform the *Data Cleaning* and *Data Preprocessing* and see how things actually are with a real world dataset. There were 
certain operations that could have been done with built-in functions of a package but I used alternate options to see how things might 
turn up. Playing around with powerful R functions has been fun.

## Visualization ##

I have visualized the dataset. It can be found on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/saurabh.jain6276#!/vizhome/US_shooting_Tableau/Overview). I wanted to explore the Tableau tool and hence to get hands dirty I made quick visualization with our dataset. 

## Getting Started ##

You can use the code here for reference or completely clone the project on your local machine. The project here contains the csv file 
(version 2). It is highly possible that new records or additional information may be added to the dataset. I'd recommend using the latest
file for your analysis. 

### Prerequisites ###

Knowing R is useful but not necessary. Its a simple language and can be picked up pretty easily. Install RStudio for a better experience 
than simple R shell.

### Steps ###
Open the project in the RStudio and execute each line of code and observe the results in the variable window.

## Contribution ##
I am the sole developer of this code. I have referenced other developers to see how they did things. Feel free to fork the code
and add improvements to the existing code 

## Acknowledgement ##
1. User github/ligyxy for his gist on Standardizing State Names.
2. Hat tip to anyone who's code from Stackoverflow was used whenever I was stuck.


## Future Scope ##
* The summary of the shootings has not been analysed as it involves text mining to certain extent. 
* Also, new version of dataset are coming up and can be used for further analysis
